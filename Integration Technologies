GRASPS Model Report 

Goals
The updated cloud computing curriculum is designed to give students both the practical skills and theoretical knowledge they need to succeed in the industry. 
It focuses on preparing students for jobs by teaching them key skills like scalability, virtualization, data analytics, and high-performance computing using AWS Academy resources.

Roles
Students take on the role of future cloud computing professionals.
They solve real-world problems with cloud technologies through hands-on labs and activities that mimic tasks they’ll face in IT jobs, such as designing scalable systems and analyzing big data

Audience
The key audience includes employers in cloud computing, schools and universities, governments, and technology providers like AWS. 
Students use the curriculum to prove their skills and readiness to these stakeholders, demonstrating they can meet the demands of the industry.

Situation
Students work in realistic scenarios where cloud computing is essential for solving technological and business problems. 
They use skills like virtualization, distributed computing, and data analytics to tackle challenges similar to those in the real world.

Product or Performance
Students create practical outputs, including prototypes, simulations, and analytical reports.
With the help of AWS Academy tools, they show their ability to design, troubleshoot, and manage cloud-based systems effectively.

Detailed Report

Introduction
As the cost of education rises, colleges and universities are under pressure to offer programs that directly help the students find a good job. 
This report looks at how the AWS Academy resources were integrated into a cloud computing course to give the students both practical experience and theoretical knowledge

Summary of Key Findings
The revised curriculum used AWS Academy’s Cloud Foundations program, which includes hands-on labs, videos, and guides aligned with industry needs. 
Students learned cloud computing best practices and explored career opportunities, including internships, with guidance from AWS professionals.

Critical Analysis
Partnering with AWS Academy ensures the course matches industry standards by providing students with hands-on experience and the chance to earn certifications, such as AWS Cloud Practitioner.
However, relying heavily on one partner (AWS) could make the program less flexible, and the results are currently limited to this course and institution.

Integration and Synthesis
Combining theory with real-world practice greatly benefits students, making this curriculum a strong model for other programs.
Expanding partnerships beyond AWS, for example, to other tech areas like data analytics and cybersecurity, could increase its value and reach.

Conclusion
This initiative is an excellent example of how schools can create programs that help students get ready for jobs. By blending classroom learning with industry experience, colleges can better prepare students for their careers.
Also schools should consider collaborating with multiple industry partners and tracking long-term success to improve the program.
